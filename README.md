# Pubmed-analysis
Project on data analysis from pubmed

I am publishing part of my project using implementation of the EasyPubMed package.

Very broadly there are three main parts to it:
  - Querying the data from pubmed
  - Formatting the data accordingly - I am trying to implement parralel calculation there stay tuned
  - Filtering and processing the data as per your needs
